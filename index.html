							<p>I'm Mike Jones, a post-doctoral researcher working with David Sand at the University of Arizona. I was previously a Juan de la Cierva post-doctoral fellow at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía working with Lourdes Verdes-Montenegro. My research is in extragalactic astronomy, focusing on low-mass galaxies in the local Universe, in particular those which push the boundaries of our current understanding of galaxy formation. I graduated with a PhD in Astronomy from Cornell University in 2016 after 5 years working with Martha Haynes and Riccardo Giovanelli on the <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/alfalfa/">ALFALFA</a> survey. I gained my undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences (Astrophysics) from the University of Cambridge in 2011. I love the outdoors and regularly play football (soccer), cycle, hike and occasionally rock climb. I am also fond of photography, including astrophotography.</p>

							<button type="button" class="collapsible">Young isolated stellar systems in the Virgo cluster</button>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Galaxy clusters are filled with an intra-cluster medium of hot gas that makes them an extremely hostile environment for any galaxy containing the cool gas needed to form stars. Even fairly massive galaxies like our own Milky Way would be rapidly stripped of gas when they fall into a galaxy cluster. Hence our surprise when in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220501695J/abstract">Jones et al. 2022</a> we identified a new class of isolated stellar system in the Virgo cluster, which are typically 1 million times less massive that the Milky Way, but are made up entirely of recently formed stars. These objects are also very metal-rich for their mass. Generally elements heavier than helium are built up in galaxies through successive episodes of star formation. Some of these blue stellar systems have metallicities comparable to the Milky Way, indicating that they formed from gas stripped from galaxies similar to our own (as they could never have built up some many metals on their own).

								<p>Even if these "blue blobs" did form from stripped gas, the question remains, what process stripped the gas and how did they get so isolated? Gas is stripped from galaxies in two ways, tidal stripping and ram pressure stripping. Tidal stripping occurs due to the gravity of another galaxy passing nearby that pulls the outskirts of the first galaxy towards it. Ram pressure stripping occurs when a gas-rich galaxy is travelling at high speed through a hot gas medium (like in a galaxy cluster) and the pressure of this gas forces out its own gas. This is like running into the wind or belly flopping into a swimming pool, except your body is solid, not made of gas. Although either of these mechanisms could be responisble for creating the blue stellar systems we discovered, only ram pressure stripping can explain their isolation because it occurs at such high speeds. This way these objects can become separated from their parent galaxies by great distances while they are still very young.</p>

							<button type="button" class="collapsible">Gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies</button>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Ultra-diffuse galaxies, or UDGs, are a class of recently identified extremely low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies which have been principally found in galaxy clusters. While astronomers have been studying LSB galaxies for decades, including some which are now classified as UDGs, the striking results of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...798L..45V">van Dokkum et al. 2015</a> and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...807L...2K">Koda et al. 2015</a> show just how prevalent they are, even at the lowest surface brightnesses and in dense cluster environments. There are many open questions about the formation and survival of these galaxies and their connection to the other LSB galaxies and normal galaxies.</p>

								<p>While the vast majority of UDGs are red, spheroidal objects located in or around groups and clusters, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...842..133L">Leisman et al. 2017</a> identified a sample of isolated, blue, HI-bearing UDGs (HUDs) that were strongly detected as HI sources in ALFALFA, but have almost invisible optical counterparts in the <a href="https://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>. In <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...614A..21J">Jones et al. 2018c</a> we measured the cosmic number density of these source by comparison with the global ALFALFA population, and found that although many fewer HUDs than red UDGs have been found to date, their overall abundances are likely quite similar. However, the connection between HUDs and red UDGs remains uncertain; they may be two phases of one population or two completely separate populations.</p>
								
								<p>I am the PI of a Hubble Space Telescope snapshot program to investigate the the globular systems of HUDs and compare them to both those of normal galaxies and UDGs in denser environments. As globular clusters are thought to form early on in a galaxy's life cycle a comparison of these systems should help to reveal whether there is a deeper connection between HUDs and other UDGs, or if they really are separate populations with separate formation pathways.</p>

The latter was calculated by integrating the relationship between halo mass and number of UDGs (measured by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607A..79V/abstract">van der Burg et al. 2017</a>) over the halo mass function (from high to low masses).</h8>

							<button type="button" class="collapsible">AMIGA: A control sample of isolated galaxies</button>
							<div class="content">
  								<p>The <a href="http://www.amiga.iaa.es">AMIGA</a> project (Analysis of the interstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies) focuses on a population of carefully selected, isolated galaxies and has collected a rich multi-wavelength dataset to characterise their properties. This sample defines a benchmark for galaxies that reside in an almost nurture-free environment and thus acts as a control sample for studies of the impact on interactions on galaxy properties, whether it be star formation rates, gas content, AGN activity, or numerous others. In addition, these galaxies form an ideal laboratory for investigating secular evolution in galaxies, as the influence of neighbours is minimised.</p>

								<p>In <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...609A..17J">Jones et al. 2018a</a> I used the global HI profiles of several hundred isolated galaxies, observed by the AMIGA team or gathered from the literature, to define a new standard for the HI content of galaxies in the absence of interactions. The resulting optical to HI scaling relations had not been updated for the most isolated galaxies since <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984AJ.....89..758H">Haynes & Giovanelli 1984</a>, with most of the other recent scaling relations being measured with sources from HI surveys, which are intrinsically biased towards gas-rich galaxies. The increased sample size, morphological diversity, and improved maximum likelihood fitting method also gave more self-consistent relations than found previously.</p>

							<button type="button" class="collapsible">Hickson Compact Groups</button>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) are extremely dense groups of 4-10 galaxies in the local Universe. HCG 16 is a prototypical case of a compact group of galaxies in an intermediate stage of evolution, where its neutral gas has been heavily disturbed, but not yet lost or consumed (as hypothesised by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001A%26A...377..812V/abstract">Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001</a>). The group is made up of two spirals with low star formation rates, and two star bursting lenticulars. There is a 5th galaxy (NGC 848) to the south-east which optically might not appear to have interacted with the core group, but in HI is clearly connected to it by a ~160 kpc long tidal tail.</p>


								<p>Although most of the extended HI gas resides in the vicinity of the two lenticular galaxies, comparison with scaling relations reveal that neither of these are deficient in HI. In fact the only HI-deficient galaxies in the group are the two spirals, which have both lost over 90% of their expected HI content. This led us to conclude in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...632A..78J/abstract">Jones et al. 2019</a> that most of the extended HI was likely disrupted by the passage of NGC 848, but was probably already loosely bound due to the ongoing interaction between the two spirals. Furthermore, the tidal tail to the SE is actually considerably longer than it appears and forms a continuous structure from NGC 848 all the way to the NW corner of the group. Finally, there is a strong candidate tidal dwarf galaxy between the two galaxy pairs, that is also right on the boundary of being classified as an ultra-diffuse galaxy.</p>

							<button type="button" class="collapsible">ALFALFA: A blind census of gas-bearing galaxies</button>
							<div class="content">
								<p>During my PhD I worked with Professors Martha Haynes and Riccardo Giovanelli on the <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/alfalfa/">ALFALFA</a> HI survey, a blind 21 cm survey out to a maximum redshift of 0.06 and covering 7,000 square degrees of the sky. ALFALFA represents the cutting edge of large area, blind HI surveys. It used the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, the largest single dish telescope in the world at the time, and a 7 pixel feed array (ALFA). The final HI source catalogue contains over 30,000 extragalactic source and can be found <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/alfalfa/data/index.php">here</a>.</p>

								<p>My research focused on the global properties of the survey, investigating the statistical trends and biases present in the dataset. This included a quantification of the impact of source confusion on current and future HI surveys (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.449.1856J">Jones et al. 2015</a>) and the construction of a generic model for the contribution of confusion noise to deep HI stacking experiments (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.455.1574J">Jones et al. 2016a</a>). My cloud-based tool for predicting the level of source confusion in a generic stacking experiment can be found <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jonesmg/HI_stack_confusion/master">here</a>. I also investigated the role environment plays in influencing the shape of the HI mass function of galaxies (HIMF), finding that the ‘knee’ mass increases towards denser regions, but not finding any evidence of a change in the low-mass slope (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.457.4393J">Jones et al. 2016b</a>).</p>

								<p>My work on ALFALFA, and in particular the HIMF, has continued as a post-doc. In <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477....2J">Jones et al. 2018b</a> I calculated the HIMF for the final ALFALFA sample (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...861...49H">Haynes et al. 2018</a>). This is the most precise measurement of the HIMF to date. However, while the ‘knee’ is determined over a cosmologically fair volume and varies little across the survey footprint, the low-mass slope is only measurable in the relatively nearby Universe (D &lt; 60 Mpc) with ALFALFA. Hence we see large shifts in the gradient of the low-mass slope in different regions of the sky. There is tentative evidence that the low-mass slope steepens within the large scale overdensity surrounding the Virgo cluster, perhaps due to the presence of gas-rich inflowing filaments, and flattens in the void in the foreground of the Pisces-Perseus supercluster. However, more investigation is required.</p>

								<p>I am the co-PI (along with Rebecca Koopmann) of the Arecibo Pisces-Perseus Supercluster Survey (APPSS). This is an ALFALFA follow-up program to observe dwarf galaxies, below the ALFALFA sensitivity limit, in order to increase the source density of galaxies with known redshifts and velocity widths in the vicinity of PPS. With this dataset we aim to measure with high signal-to-noise the radial inflow of galaxies onto the supercluster filament through the use of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. The majority of the work for this project is being conducted by the student and faculty members of the Undergraduate ALFALFA Team (UAT, organised by Martha Haynes and Rebecca Koopmann), a network of undergraduate-focused institutions across the USA that contribute and gain research experience within the wider ALFALFA project.</p>

								<h2>Outreach & Teaching</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p><b>Mentoring:</b> I have mentored several undergraduate students beginning their astronomy research careers at both Cornell and the University of Arizona, as well as a Tucson high school student. While at Cornell I co-wrote and led workshops on using Python and TOPCAT in astronomy for students in the REU program, and lectured and demostrated observing at Arecibo for members of the Undergraduate ALFALFA Team.</p>
							
							<p><b>Teaching:</b> I was a teaching assistant for Cornell's Astro1101 and Astro1102 courses for two years. I led two weekly sections, typically with around 20-30 students, as well as performing a guest lecture to the full class (around 200 students). I wrote and graded both homeworks and exams for these courses. I also gave guest lectures for Cornell's first-year writing seminars in astronomy.</p>

							<p><b>Outreach:</b> While at UA I have lectured for a hands-on, astronomy-themed, introductory Python class for students at Pima Community College, given an Astronomy on Tap public talk, and appeared on <a href="https://www.kold.com/2022/06/19/out-this-world-discovery-how-tucson-astronomers-played-part-finding-new-stellar-system/">local TV</a> to discuss the new blue stellar systems we discovered. At Cornell I participated in numerous outreaching initiatives, such as Focus for Teens, Museum in the Dark, and Ask an Astronomer.
